# HackerRank_Tests
Some of the most interesting tests I've found in HackerRank so far.

* Palindrome Index: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/palindrome-index/problem
* Time conversion: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/time-conversion/problem
* Caesar Cipher: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem

The are two of my favorite challenges because of how complex the problem looks, but how really simple the solution actually is. 
"Keep it simple", right?

* Flipping the matrix problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/flipping-the-matrix/problem
* Tower Breakers: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tower-breakers-1/problem
